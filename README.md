# PDAC_research

A repository with notebooks, code, figures pertaining to user testing of the Prototype Data Access Center  
( http://lsst-sui-proxy01.ncsa.illinois.edu/suit ).  Much info is on the PDAC guide . The explanation of DataBase Schema (i.e. 
how are columns named, what they contain, all the metadata) is on https://lsst-web.ncsa.illinois.edu/schema/index.php?t=DeepForcedSource&sVer=S12_lsstsim
 (very helpful for making queries)

Especially helpful are the sample SQL queries at  https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/display/DM/PDAC+sample+queries+and+test+cases
